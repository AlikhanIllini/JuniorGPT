# JuniorGPT: A GPT Implementation for Shakespeare Dataset
JuniorGPT is a light implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model focused on generating text in the style of Shakespeare. This repository contains code to train a model using a subset of Shakespeare's works and subsequently generate text resembling the bard's style.

# Project Overview
JuniorGPT is designed to:
1. Load Shakespeare text data.
2. Tokenize the data and create a vocabulary.
3. Define and initialize a GPT-like architecture.
4. Train the model.
5. Generate Shakespearean-style text.
