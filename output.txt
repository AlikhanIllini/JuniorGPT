In the midst of starlit verses and time's sway,

ANTHONIO:
By the stars, fair Callista, thy eyes gleam
Brighter than Venus in her midnight dream.
The winds, they whisper secrets unto me,
Of love's untold and endless majesty.

CALLISTA:
Anthonio, thy words flatter the very soul,
But are they true, or just tales to extol?
For in this court, many a heart's been led,
By honeyed words and promises unsaid.

LORD FERNANDO:
Hark, the hour approaches nigh,
Where shadows dance and spirits sigh.
By this night's end, a truth unveiled,
Of a tale so grim, yet love entailed.

LADY BEATRICE:
Fernando, speak not in riddles, pray,
For the night's dark secrets scare the day.
Yet, in thy eyes, I see a plot unfold,
A tale of power, ambition, gold.

SIR LUCIUS:
In yon corner, where the candle's dim,
I heard a tale most strange and grim.
A betrayal, a dagger, and a throne's deceit,
Where love and ambition did meet.

PRINCESS ELENA:
Lucius, thy tales are of no concern,
For in this court, the wheels ever turn.
Trust no one, not even thine own heart,
For every end has a fateful start.

MISTRESS LYDIA:
With every word, a seed's been sown,
In the garden of intrigue, where truth's unknown.
Trust, love, and loyalty's fee,
Paid in whispers, shadows, and glee.

BARON OSWALD:
Yet, amidst the intrigue, lies and spies,
One truth stands firm, never denies.
That love, though fleeting, never dies,
But rises anew, under the skies.

In the court of shadows and light's decree,
The tales of love, betrayal, and glee,
Unfold like petals, for all to see,
In the dance of fate and destiny.
