"Forsooth, in the gentle caress of night,
When stars do twinkle and moon takes flight,
There lies a tale of love and woe,
Of brave knights and maidens fair, in shadows they go.

Sir Lancelot, with armor so bright,
Did venture forth, in the dead of night.
To seek the grail, so pure and true,
Yet destiny's hand, a different path drew.

In yonder castle, with turrets high,
Lies fair Guinevere, with a tearful sigh.
Her heart aches for love's sweet embrace,
Yet fate's cruel hand, keeps them apart, in this endless chase.

Alas, in this world of treachery and deceit,
True love's path is never so neat.
For in the end, it is not for us to decide,
The course of love, where destiny and fate collide."
